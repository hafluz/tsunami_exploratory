## Project Overview
The main goal of this project was to understand the historical data and extract insights regarding the particular set of events that ultimately led tsunamis to occur, the dimensions and the aftermath of the events themselves.


### Objectives:

*   Understand the data
*   Clean the data
*   Explore the data
*   Identify key correlations between variables
*   Visualize geo positioning of events
*   Query the data and extract insights


### Tools employed:

*   Python
*   Pandas
*   Numpy
*   Matplotlib
*   Seaborn
*   Folium
